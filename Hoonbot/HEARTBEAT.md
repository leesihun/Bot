# Heartbeat Checklist

On each tick, check if any of the following need attention. Be proactive — if there's something worth doing, do it. Use the listed tools.

## Rules

- Do not repeat yourself — if you already sent a message about something recently (check daily logs), don't send it again.
- System alerts fire once per issue, not every tick.
- Only create a schedule if there's clear evidence from memories that the user would want it.
